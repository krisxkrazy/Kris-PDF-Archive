[Enjoy & feel free to contribute!]

Please Enjoy! I work very heard in my research endeavor's as a philomath and there is not really a single topic that bores me. I love talking about thing's I don't know and learning them. My Favorite topics however have to do with computer science followed by quantum mechanics. I will also post my note's and/or other notes I have foound to be useful on the topic(s). 

Here's why:
* Your spare time should be focused on learning topic's you love and then contributing to the world with your newfound knowledge!
* Researching topics keeps your mind healthy and sharp. 
* Learning new thing's will give various reasons to keep conversation's going.
